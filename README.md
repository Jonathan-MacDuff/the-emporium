Welcome to my website! Here, you'll find all my personal projects, blogs, and other relevant information. You can also contact me by filling out the appropriate form.

For now, I'm leaving this unhosted, so to get started, fork and clone this repo to your personal environment. You'll need to run "npm run server" and "npm start" in two seperate terminal windows.
